Django Tutorial Blog NG
=======================

The source for the new version of my Django tutorial blog.

The original is somewhat outdated and doesn't reflect best practices, so this is a newer version. Unlike the original, it was built using TDD practices and has 100% test coverage.

The tutorials can be found [here](http://matthewdaly.co.uk/blog/categories/django/)
